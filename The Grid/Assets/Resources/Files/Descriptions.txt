===
Mushroom
===
Appearance : on dirt, with temperature between 30 and 40, and humidity >= 80. 50% chance per hour
Disappearance : temperature or humidity out of previous intervals
Effects : can grow by 1 with 50% chances per hour. Maximum 12
===
Diamond
===
Appearance : from carbon, with pressure = 100, and temperature = 100
Disappearance : 
Effects :
Solid : Yes
Heat transfer resistance : -1
Can lead to :
Can generate :
===
Water
===
Appearance : from void, with temperature <= 50, and heat = 100
Disappearance : humidity = 0, or close to fire, or entirely corroded a stone
Effects : Corrodes stone by 3% each 10s, humidifies neighbours by 10 per hour
Solid : No
Heat transfer resistance : 10
Can lead to : Ice, Steam, Void
Can generate : Organisms
===
Fire
===
Appearance : on a block which can burn, with humidity = 0 and temperature = 100
Disappearance : the block cannot burn anymore, or close to a water block
Effects : spreads to a neighboring cell every 3H, drains neighbours by 10 and warms them up by 10 per hour
===
Ice
===
Appearance : from water, with temperature <= 5
Disappearance : temperature > 5, become water
Effects : if neighboring cells are water with temperature <=10, brings their temperature to 5
Solid : Yes
Heat transfer resistance : 5
Can lead to : Water, Void
Can generate : 
===
Grass
===
Appearance : on dirt, with humidity > 30 during 1H
Disappearance : 
Effects : if a neighboring cell is on fire during 25s, the grass takes fire
===
Lava
===
Appearance : from stone, with temperature > 95
Disappearance : temperature < 85, become stone
Effects : a neighboring cell takes fire every 3H, drains neighbours by 20 and warms them up by 20 every 3H
Solid : No
Heat transfer resistance : 2
Can lead to : Stone
Can generate : 
===
Cloud
===
Appearance : humidity >= 80, 50% chances per hour
Disappearance : (120-Humidity)% chances to disappear to give 20 humidity to the cell per hour
Effects : the heat of the case doesn't follow the day and night cycle anymore, the clouds move in the direction of the wind every hour
===
Organism
===
Appearance : on water, with temperature between 45 and 50, 30% chances per hour
Disappearance : temperature out of the 45 to 55 range
Effects : grows by 1 per hour. Maximum 10. Every 2H, an organism has 80% chances to move to a neighboring cell
===
Stone
===
Appearance : from void, with temperature <= 50 and humidity = 0
Disappearance : entirely corroded, becomes void or sand
Effects :
Solid : Yes
Heat transfer resistance : 5
Can lead to : Carbon (burning 8H), Lava, Sand, Void
Can generate : 
===
Sand
===
Appearance : from void, with temperature <= 50 and humidity between 1 and 9 or from stone corroded by water block with pressure > 70
Disappearance : pressure >= 80, becomes stone
Effects : 
Solid : Yes if humidity <= 70, no otherwise
Heat transfer resistance : 5
Can lead to : Carbon (burning 2H), Stone
Can generate : 
===
Dirt
===
Appearance : from void, with temperature <= 60 and humidity between 10 and 20
Disappearance :
Effects : 
Solid : Yes
Heat transfer resistance : 3
Can lead to : Carbon (burning 3H)
Can generate : Grass, Mushroom
===
Steam
===
Appearance : from water, with temperature >= 90 and humidity >= 80
Disappearance : temperature <= 85 and humidity <=75
Effects : Humidify neighboring cells by 5 per hour
Solid : No
Heat transfer resistance : 3
Can lead to : Void
Can generate : 
===
Void
