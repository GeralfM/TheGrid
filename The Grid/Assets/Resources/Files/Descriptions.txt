<b>Can lead to :</b> Stone
<b>Can generate :</b> 
===
Cloud
===
<b>Appearance :</b> humidity >= 80, 50% chances per hour
<b>Disappearance :</b> (120-Humidity)% chances to disappear to give 20 humidity to the cell per hour
<b>Effects :</b> the heat of the case doesn't follow the day and night cycle anymore, the clouds move in the direction of the wind every hour
===
